# JAVA-Data-Structures
📖 About the Repository:

I have started on a journey to learn and master Java. Starting from today, I’ll be posting my progress every single day for a year! This repository will include everything from the basics of Java to more advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Algorithms.

Through this journey, I aim to improve my coding skills and build a solid foundation in Java. The repository will serve as a reflection of my daily progress, and hopefully, it will also help others who are learning Java!

🛠 Topics Covered:

- Java Basics:
Syntax and Fundamentals
Data Types, Variables, and Operators
Control Flow (Loops, Conditionals)
Methods and Functions
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- Classes and Objects:
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction
Interfaces and Abstract Classes
Data Structures:

- Arrays and Strings:
Lists, Sets, and Maps
Stacks and Queues
Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs
Algorithms:

- Sorting and Searching:
Recursion and Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms and Backtracking
Advanced Java:

- Exception Handling:
File I/O
Multithreading and Concurrency
Java Collections Framework
Coding Challenges:

Daily practice of coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and more.
📅 Commitment to Daily Progress
I’m committing to:

- Posting new content or a project every day.
- Focusing on practical coding and conceptual understanding.
- Solving coding challenges, working on Java mini-projects, and documenting each step here.
- Each day, a new folder will be created for that day’s work with solutions, explanations, and code.

🌱 How This Repository Will Evolve:

- Short-term goals: Strengthen my basics and improve problem-solving skills.
 -Long-term goals: Build complex projects, contribute to open-source Java repositories, and gain a deeper understanding of Java frameworks and libraries.
 -This repository is my learning companion, and it’ll evolve as I progress through the language.

🎯 Goals for This Journey:

- Become proficient in Java and its core libraries.
- Learn and implement key Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Develop practical projects to showcase my learning.
- Contribute to Java open-source projects.
- Improve problem-solving skills through coding challenges.
